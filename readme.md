# UPXCore Mini-Stack Web Project

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate a full-stack web application using a combination of modern technologies. The stack includes:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the frontend, providing server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Express.js + SQLite**: A lightweight and flexible server framework for Node.js, used here with SQLite for a simple, file-based database solution for the API backend.
- **PHP**: Utilized for content delivery, handling dynamic content serving with simplicity and efficiency.
- **Python**: Script utilities to support various backend operations, automation tasks, or data processing needs.

## Project Structure

```
/root-project
    /frontend          # Next.js frontend application
    /backend           # Express.js API with SQLite database and PHP script
    /resource          # content delivery resources
    /utils             # Python utility scripts
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PHP server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a native PHP installation)
- Python

### Installation

1. **Frontend Setup**:
    - Navigate to `/frontend`.
    - Install dependencies with `npm install`.
    - Run the development server with `npm run dev`.

2. **Backend Setup**:
    - Navigate to `/backend`.
    - Install dependencies with `npm install`.
    - Start the Express.js server with `npm start`.

3. **PHP Content Delivery**:
    - Place the PHP scripts inside your PHP server's root directory.
    - Ensure the server is running to serve the PHP content.

4. **Python Utilities**:
    - Ensure Python is installed and configured on your system.
    - Use the scripts within `/utils` as needed, running them directly with Python.

### Usage

- Access the Next.js frontend application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
- Interact with the Express.js API backend through the endpoints defined in `/backend`.
- PHP content can be accessed as configured in your PHP server environment.
- Utilize Python scripts directly from the command line for any utility purposes.
